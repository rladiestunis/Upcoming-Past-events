**Tidying Up Messy Data**

We are pleased to invite you to our next meetup : Tidying Up Messy Data.

Data cleaning has always been a challenging task for every data scientist. Tidy Data is a way of structuring datasets to facilitate analysis. During the workship, you will learn about how to organize messy datasets in an efficient manner. The workshop will cover a live coding.

▶️ Invited trainer : Dr. Bruno Grande

▶️ About Dr. Bruno Grande https://www.linkedin.com/in/brunograndephd/

Dr. Bruno Grande (he/him) has been training others in the ways of modern R programming since 2015. With a PhD in bioinformatics, he learned (the hard way) how to leverage the tidyverse toolbox to efficiently transform, analyze, and visualize data ranging from messy to tidy. As a Carpentries- and RStudio-certified trainer, he wishes to empower the next generation of researchers and professionals with the same data science skills that continue to bolster his career. He’s currently promoting and implementing best practices in open science as a Bioinformatics Engineer at Sage Bionetworks in Seattle, WA.
